Data in ReactJS  reactjs.org

yarn start
npm start

Rarely ever set variables globally
	-Variables are managed internally for each component

State refers to internal data of component ('inside')
	-state declared in constructor
	-contains the state of component (attributes that effect rendering & what user sees)
	-used to modify appearance in JSX
	-register events & user interactions
	-can populate dynamically
		-ie: dropdown menu only if user clicks

Props is how we communicate data between components ('between')

Constructor
	-very fundamental 
	-before other methods/components - lets other methods know what to have (ie: state, bindings)
