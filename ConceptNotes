Data in ReactJS  reactjs.org

yarn start
npm start

Rarely ever set variables globally
	-Variables are managed internally for each component

State refers to internal data of component ('inside')
	-state declared in constructor
	-contains the state of component (attributes that effect rendering & what user sees)
	-used to modify appearance in JSX
	-register events & user interactions
	-can populate dynamically
		-ie: dropdown menu only if user clicks

Props is how we communicate data between components ('between')
	-passing data
	-can chain props together w/ state
	-can become state of component it's passed to
	-keep under control, try not to pass down through a lot of child components, there are better ways to manage data
	-If you have a component that isn't using a prop (doesn't display or effect the display of it), then don't give that component the information - reduces the cognitive load of understanding/following the code

Constructor
	-very fundamental 
	-before other methods/components - lets other methods know what to have (ie: state, bindings)
